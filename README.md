# Footall_Players_Performance_prediction
This repository exists to store a mini project I did as a practice of the basic workflow of a machine learning task. The data is acquired using the web crawler developed by Diogo Dantas and Arnaldo Gualberto, and contains statistics describing the past performance of sofifa players. The project compares 4 machine learning methods including SGDregressor, KNN, random forest and support vector machine on predicting the goals scored by the players.
